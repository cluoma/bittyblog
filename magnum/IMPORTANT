This project is designed for use with cmake.

The Makefile controls the overall build:

	make
	make release

Build a version optimized for performance.

	make debug

Faster compile, but not as high performance.  Enables test suite support.

	make xcode

Create an Xcode project for use on OS X.

	make windows

Used for cross-compiling for Windows using MinGW.

	make documentation

Setup a `doxygen` configuration file based on project information, and then
generate HTML and LaTeX documentation.

	make clean

Clean up the `build` directory.

These commands control the `build` directory.  Everything in this directory is
auto-generated.  You should not manually change these files or put anything
else in there.


The setup is designed to support unit testing with CuTest.  Functions along
the lines of `void Test*` will be located automatically and used to create the
test suite, which is run by:

	./run_tests

Or

	make test

(The `run_tests` approach will probably give more useful feedback if a test fails.)


Integration testing must be handled separately.

You can configure the `CMakeLists.txt` to support creating installers.
